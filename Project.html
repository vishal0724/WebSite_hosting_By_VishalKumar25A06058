            <h2>Word Association Game</h2>
            <section>
                The Word Association Game is a simple activity where one person 
                says a word and the other responds with the first related word 
                that comes to mind. It helps improve quick thinking, vocabulary, 
                creativity, and communication skills. The game is commonly used 
                for fun, brainstorming, team-building, and even in interviews 
                to observe a person's thought process.

            <h2>Python-based Library Management</h2>
            <section>
                This Python-based Library Management System is designed to manage books, authors, and members using a JSON 
                file for data storage. It follows an object-oriented approach with classes for Library, Book, Author, and 
                Member. The system supports adding, removing, issuing books, and viewing borrowed books, making it a simple 
                but functional console-based application.
                The program starts by importing the required modules: os for file handling and json for reading and writing 
                data. Data is stored in a file named lib_data.json, and two helper functions, load_data() and save_data(), 
                manage reading and writing JSON data. If the file does not exist or is empty, an empty dictionary is returned.
                The Library class acts as the central component. During initialization, it loads existing books, authors, 
                and members from the JSON file. Each entry is converted into its corresponding object form (Book, Author, 
                Member). This ensures that the program starts with the most recent saved data.
                The system includes several important operations:<br><br>
                <div class="indentation">
                    1. Add Book
                            A book is added by creating a Book object and appending it to the library’s book list. The book details 
                            are also added to the JSON file to ensure permanent storage.<br><br>
                    2. Remove Book
                            Books are removed from both the in-memory list and the JSON file. The function searches for the book by 
                            name and updates the stored data.<br><br>
                    3. Add Author
                            Authors are added by creating an Author object and storing their name in the JSON file.<br><br>
                    4. Remove Author
                            Similar to removing books, this function deletes an author from both internal memory and JSON.<br><br>
                    5. Add Member
                            A new member is registered in the system with an empty borrowed-books list. Their data is saved to JSON 
                            to maintain persistence across program runs.<br><br>
                    6. Remove Member
                            Members are removed using their name, and their record is deleted from the JSON file.<br><br>
                    7. Search Book
                            The system checks if a book exists in the current library list and, if found, displays its details such 
                            as name, author, and publication year.<br><br>
                    8. Book List
                            Displays all books available in the library with basic information like title, author, 
                            and publication year.<br><br>
                    9. Issue Book
                            This is one of the most important features. When a book is issued, the program checks whether the book 
                            and member exist. It also ensures the member does not already have the same book issued. If valid, the 
                            book is added to the member’s borrowed_books list in both in-memory objects and JSON storage.<br><br>
                    10. View Borrowed Books
                            Users can view all books currently borrowed by a specific member. The system displays each book’s name, 
                            author, and publication year.<br><br>
                </div>
                The main() function acts as the user interface. It displays a menu and takes user input for different actions. 
                Based on the chosen option, it calls the corresponding Library class method.
                In summary, this Library Management System demonstrates file handling, JSON storage, object-oriented programming, 
                and basic data management operations. It provides a simple but effective model for managing library records persistently.

            <h2>HangMan Game Via Python</h2>
            <section>
                Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other 
                tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word is shown as blanks, and for every wrong 
                guess, a part of a stick-figure hangman is drawn. The goal is to guess the complete word 
                before the drawing is finished. It tests vocabulary, logic, and guessing skills. In digital 
                versions, players get a fixed number of lives, see letters already guessed, and receive 
                hints. The game ends when the player either completes the word or runs out of chances.
